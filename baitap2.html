	<h1>Floating-point number arithmetic</h1>
	
	<p class="center">
		In computing, <b>floating-point arithmetic</b> is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen. A number that can be represented exactly is of the following form:
	</p>
	
	<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant</i></b> &times; <i><b>base</i></b> <sup><i>exponent</i></sup></p>
	
	<p>where significand is an integer (i.e., in Z), base is an integer greater than or equal to two, and exponent is also an integer. For example:</p>
	
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.22345 &#61; 12345 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup>. 
	</p>
	<p class="upper">
		The term <em>floating point</em> refers to the fact that a number's radix point (<em>decimal point</em>, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of scientific notation.

	<h2>Floating-point numbers</h2>
	<p>
		Floating-point representation is similar in concept to scientific notation. Logically, a floating-point number consists of:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A signed (meaning negative or non-negative) digit string of a given length in a given base (or radix). This digit string is referred to as the <i>significand</i>, <i>mantissa</i>, or <i>coefficient</i>. The length of the significand determines the <i>precision</i> to which numbers can be represented. The radix point position is assumed always to be somewhere within the significand—often just after or just before the most significant digit, or to the right of the rightmost (least significant) digit. This article generally follows the convention that the radix point is set just after the most significant (leftmost) digit.
		</li>
		<li>A signed integer exponent (also referred to as the characteristic, or scale), which modifies the magnitude of the number.</li>
